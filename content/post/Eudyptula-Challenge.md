What is Endyptula Challenge? You can get answer at [http://www.eudyptula-challenge.org/](http://www.eudyptula-challenge.org/). If you want to learn linux kernel programming or linux device driver programming, I highly recommend you to finish this challenge.

When we learn linux kernel programming, there are many books we can read.

* [\<Linux Kernel Development\>](http://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458812440&sr=8-1&keywords=linux+kernel+development)
* [\<Linux Device Drivers\>](http://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-3rd-Edition/dp/0596005903/ref=pd_bxgy_14_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1TXM04ZY6GN1PZXPFCCF)
* [\<Understanding the Linux Kernel, Third Edition\>](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Linux-Kernel-Third-Edition/dp/0596005652/ref=pd_bxgy_14_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=16X7YFZVM2P5F6A4RY1H)

But for linux kernel programming, there are also many information and knowledge to understand. We always lost in these books.

Eudyptula Challenge is a good guider to take you walking through the linux kernel programming forest. Create "Hello World" module, compile linux kernel source code, create real linux kernel patch and send it out...

From 20 tasks we can learn many useful knowledge. Like we find a way in the forest to learn linux kernel programming, we will never lost in knowledge forest.

I took one year to finish this challenge. I'm number 84 to pass it.

Now send email and atttend challenge, you will open the linux kernel programming door.
